# 🧬 Bioinformatics – Coursera Series (UC San Diego)

This repository contains my full set of solutions and implementations for the **Bioinformatics Specialization** offered by the University of California San Diego on Coursera.

All projects were completed using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebooks**, and are grouped into two sections:
- **Bioinformatics I – Finding Hidden Messages in DNA**
- **Bioinformatics II – Reconstructing Genes from Read-Pieces**

---

## 📘 Course Modules

### 📁 `Bioinformatics_I/` – *Finding Hidden Messages in DNA*

This part of the specialization focuses on **string algorithms** applied to DNA sequences. Topics include:

- Pattern matching and reverse complements
- Approximate string matching with Hamming distance
- k-mer frequency and clump finding
- Motif discovery using brute-force, greedy, randomized, and Gibbs sampling
- Profile matrices, consensus strings, scoring

All notebooks are divided into subfolders by topic, such as:
- `01-pattern-matching/`
- `02-frequency-analysis/`
- `03-mismatches-and-neighbors/`
- `04-motif-search/`
- `05-probability-tools/`
- `06-motif-utilities/`

### 📁 `Bioinformatics_II/` – *Reconstructing Genes from Read-Pieces*

This second part focuses on **genome assembly and peptide sequencing**, using graphs and mass spectrometry algorithms.

#### 🔷 `01-graph-based-assembly/`
Algorithms based on graph theory and genome reconstruction:
- k-mer composition
- Overlap graphs
- De Bruijn graphs
- Eulerian paths & cycles
- Contig construction and genome reassembly

#### 🔷 `02-peptide-sequencing/`
Mass spectrometry-based peptide inference and cyclopeptide sequencing:
- Spectrum generation and scoring
- Leaderboard and convolution-based sequencing
- Linear and cyclic peptide spectrum matching
- Spectral convolution and noise trimming

#### 🔷 `03-translation-coding/`
Bridging DNA and peptide sequences:
- Peptide encoding from DNA
- Reading gapped patterns and translation logic

#### 🔷 `exercises/`
Additional exercise notebooks for testing and review
