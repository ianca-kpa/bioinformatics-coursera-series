# 🧬 Bioinformatics – Coursera Series (UC San Diego)

This repository contains my personal implementation of algorithmic problems from the **Bioinformatics Specialization** on Coursera, offered by the University of California San Diego.

The project is divided into two main parts, reflecting the content of the first two courses of the specialization:  
**Bioinformatics I – Finding Hidden Messages in DNA**  
**Bioinformatics II – Reconstructing Genes from Read-Pieces**

All code is written in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**, with no external libraries.

## 📘 What you'll find here

### 📁 `Bioinformatics_I/` – *Finding Hidden Messages in DNA*
This section covers basic string algorithms used in bioinformatics, including:
- Searching for patterns in DNA sequences (exact and approximate)
- Counting frequent motifs (k-mers)
- Reverse complements and mismatches
- Motif discovery using brute-force, greedy, randomized, and Gibbs sampling approaches
- Calculating consensus sequences and scoring motifs

These topics are essential for understanding how DNA sequences are analyzed and interpreted computationally.

### 📁 `Bioinformatics_II/` – *Genome Sequencing Bioinformatics_II*
This section focuses on graph-based approaches to DNA assembly:
- Building overlap graphs from short DNA reads
- Constructing De Bruijn graphs from k-mers
- Reconstructing genome sequences using Eulerian paths
- Working with paired reads and fragmented genomes

These methods simulate how modern sequencing machines process and reassemble genomes from small fragments.
