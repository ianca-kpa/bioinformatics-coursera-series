# 🧬 Finding Hidden Messages in DNA – Bioinformatics I (UC San Diego / Coursera)

This repository contains my full set of algorithm implementations and exercises from the Coursera course  
**“Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)”**, offered by the University of California San Diego.

The notebooks are organized by topic and demonstrate the application of classic string algorithms to biological data, particularly DNA sequence analysis.
