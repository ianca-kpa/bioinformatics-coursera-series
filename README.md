# 🧬 Bioinformatics – Coursera Series (UC San Diego)

This repository contains my complete work from the **Bioinformatics Specialization** on Coursera, offered by the **University of California San Diego**.  
All notebooks were developed in **Python**, using **Jupyter Notebooks**, and reflect a structured learning path in genome analysis, algorithm design, and biological data interpretation.
