    "One way to solve the Frequent Words with Mismatches problem is to generate all 4k k-mers Pattern, compute ApproximatePatternCount(Text, Pattern, d) for each k-mer Pattern, and then find k-mers with the maximum number of approximate occurrences. This is an inefficient approach in practice, since many of the 4k k-mers should not be considered because neither they nor their mutated versions (with up to d mismatches) appear in Text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the following pseudocode will generalize the BetterFrequentWords function and its use of the frequency table. It uses a single map that counts the number of times a given string has an approximate match in Text. For a given k-mer substring Pattern of Text, we need to increase 1 to the count of every k-mer that has Hamming distance at most d from Pattern.  The collection of all such k-mers is called the d-neighborhood of Pattern, denoted Neighbors(Pattern, d).\n",
