# 🧬 Genome Sequencing – Bioinformatics II (UC San Diego / Coursera)

This folder contains my personal implementation of algorithms and exercises from the Coursera course  
**"Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)"**, offered by the University of California San Diego.

The course focuses on key computational techniques for **genome assembly** and **peptide sequencing**, combining graph theory and mass spectrometry algorithms.  
All notebooks were written in **Python**, using **Jupyter Notebook**.
